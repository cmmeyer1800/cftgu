# Introduction to the CFTGU ISA
Welcome, this series of markdown documents will outline the ISA that the CFTGU CPU will use

## What is an ISA
An "ISA" or Instruction Set Architecture is the interface between the software to be run on a computer and the hardware of the computer. Allowing for the end programmer to not care about the actual gates and wire of the CPU. A good ISA is critical for easy adoption of a particular
computing architecture as it allows for many hardware revisions or even hardware designs without needing to change the software.
